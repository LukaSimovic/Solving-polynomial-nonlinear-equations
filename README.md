# Solving-polynomial-nonlinear-equations
The program allows solving polynomial nonlinear equations using several different methods and also compares their efficiency in solving a given problem by showing the time in microseconds spent for each method.

Methods:
- Half-interval method
- Simple iteration method
- Cutting method
- Newton's method
- Modified Newton's method
